# Database Project

 Final project for the Basics of database systems course


In the Project there had to be just one .sql file to create the database and show the queries. However I modified the code so that you could create the database from createDatabase.sql file if the database is empty and run the other commands from the sqlcommands.sql file. You can also empty the whole database with the drop.sql file. The whole project documentation is in the pdf file.
